"""CPU-only regression tests for `gr00t.utils.dist_utils.run_or_wait_on_rank0`.

These pin the behavioural contract that motivates the helper:

  - When rank-0 raises inside the ``with`` block, *every* rank must raise
    (so the failure surfaces synchronously instead of stalling at the next
    NCCL collective for 30 minutes).
  - When the helper is used outside a torch.distributed process group, it
    must degenerate to a plain context manager that runs once and yields
    ``True``.
  - When all ranks succeed, no spurious exception is raised.
  - The body actually runs only on rank-0.

We use the gloo backend over file:// init so the tests run on CPU-only CI
without needing GPU / NCCL. A wall-clock timeout on each subprocess pins
the "no hang" guarantee — if a rank ever stalls in dist.barrier instead
of raising, the test fails on timeout rather than passing silently.
