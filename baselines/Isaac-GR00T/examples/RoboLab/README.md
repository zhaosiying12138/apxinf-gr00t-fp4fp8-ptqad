# GR00T N1.7 on RoboLab

This guide shows the validated path for running the finetuned GR00T N1.7 DROID checkpoint on RoboLab tasks through the GR00T policy server.

## Why the DROID Checkpoint

RoboLab directly uses the DROID checkpoint published with the GR00T N1.7 General Availability (GA) release, without any RoboLab-specific finetuning.

## Validation Snapshot

The current release baseline uses the public GR00T N1.7 DROID checkpoint and RoboLab's built-in GR00T client:

- GR00T model: `nvidia/GR00T-N1.7-DROID`
- Embodiment tag: `OXE_DROID_RELATIVE_EEF_RELATIVE_JOINT`
- RoboLab execution horizon: `--open-loop-horizon 8`
- Diffusion inference timesteps: model/release default, 4 denoising steps
- Episodes: 40 per task, 120 tasks

| Setup | Tasks | Episodes | Successes | Success rate |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| GR00T N1.7 DROID + RoboLab ([client](https://github.com/NVlabs/RoboLab/tree/main/policies/gr00t)) | 120 | 4,800 | 412 | 8.58% |
| N1.6 reference ([branch](https://github.com/nadunRanawaka1/Isaac-GR00T-n16-droid)) | 120 | 1,200 | 87 | 7.25% |

`--open-loop-horizon 8` is part of the reproduced result. It controls how many rows from each predicted action chunk RoboLab executes before querying the GR00T server again. It is separate from the model checkpoint action horizon.

## Successful Tasks

The N1.7 full-suite wins are concentrated in visually clear pick/place and short-horizon manipulation tasks:

| Task | Successes |
| --- | ---: |
| `BananaOnPlateTask` | 40/40 |
| `BananasInBinThreeTotalTask` | 38/40 |
| `UnstackRubiksCubeTask` | 38/40 |
| `SauceBottlesCrateTask` | 33/40 |
| `RubiksCubeOrBananaTask` | 32/40 |
| `BananaInBowlTask` | 31/40 |
| `BananasInBinOneMoreTask` | 31/40 |
| `RubiksCubeTask` | 25/40 |
| `RubiksCubeThenBananaTask` | 19/40 |
| `BananasInCrateTask` | 18/40 |
| `FoodPacking1CansTask` | 16/40 |
| `RedDishesInBinTask` | 15/40 |
| `TakeMeasuringSpoonOutTask` | 12/40 |

Failures are more common on cluttered scenes, long-horizon packing, precise shelf placement, and sequential tasks that need recovery after a poor grasp.

## Video Showcases

The final full-suite run used `--video-mode none`, so the success-rate table above is the authoritative quantitative result but not the source of MP4s. The videos below are all unique task families with at least one confirmed successful trial in the recovered diagnostic video runs. Some high-success tasks from the final table are not shown because their video shards were not recoverable.

## N1.6 Reference

The N1.6 comparison used the RoboLab author's N1.6 DROID branch:

- Code reference: [`nadunRanawaka1/Isaac-GR00T-n16-droid`](https://github.com/nadunRanawaka1/Isaac-GR00T-n16-droid)
- Model: [`nvidia/GR00T-N1.6-DROID`](https://huggingface.co/nvidia/GR00T-N1.6-DROID)
- Embodiment: `OXE_DROID` / `oxe_droid:16`
- Dashboard reference: `87/1200 = 7.25%`
- Local reproduction: `94/1200 = 7.83%`

The N1.6 runs used 10 trials per task. The N1.7 release run above used 40 trials per task, so compare success rates rather than raw success counts.

## Reproduction Steps

### Parameters

| Setting | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Model | `nvidia/GR00T-N1.7-DROID` |
| Embodiment tag | `OXE_DROID_RELATIVE_EEF_RELATIVE_JOINT` |
| GR00T server wrapper | `--use-sim-policy-wrapper` |
| Inference timesteps | Release default, 4, tried 8, giving similar result |
| RoboLab execution horizon | `--open-loop-horizon 8` |
| Observation cameras | left exterior + left wrist |
| Image transport | HWC `uint8`, no letterbox or black padding, `180x320` |

### Install

Set up Isaac-GR00T and RoboLab in separate environments. First, install Isaac-GR00T for the policy server. See the main [environment setup guide](../../README.md#set-up-the-environment) for platform-specific system requirements:

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/NVIDIA/Isaac-GR00T.git
cd Isaac-GR00T
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
uv sync --python 3.12
```

GR00T N1.7 requires access to the gated [`nvidia/Cosmos-Reason2-2B`](https://huggingface.co/nvidia/Cosmos-Reason2-2B) backbone. Request access on the model page, then authenticate:

```bash
uv run huggingface-cli login
```

In a separate terminal, install RoboLab for the simulation client. RoboLab's `uv sync` installs Isaac Sim, Isaac Lab, and the GR00T client dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/NVlabs/RoboLab.git
cd RoboLab
sudo apt install ffmpeg
uv venv --python 3.11
source .venv/bin/activate
uv sync
```

RoboLab should provide the GR00T runner:

```bash
uv run python policies/gr00t/run.py --help
```

### Start GR00T

Start one GR00T server:

```bash
cd Isaac-GR00T

CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 uv run python gr00t/eval/run_gr00t_server.py \
    --model-path nvidia/GR00T-N1.7-DROID \
    --embodiment-tag OXE_DROID_RELATIVE_EEF_RELATIVE_JOINT \
    --device cuda \
    --host 127.0.0.1 \
    --port 5555 \
    --use-sim-policy-wrapper
```

The server is ready when it prints:

```text
Server is ready and listening on tcp://127.0.0.1:5555
```

The command above assumes the server and client run on the same host. For a separate server host, bind the server to an appropriate private interface, pass its reachable hostname to RoboLab's `--remote-host`, and restrict port `5555` to the intended network boundary.

### Run RoboLab

Isaac Sim checks EULA acceptance when the process starts. Export the variable in every new terminal before launching RoboLab:

```bash
export OMNI_KIT_ACCEPT_EULA=Y
```

To avoid repeating this command, persist it in your shell startup file (for example, `~/.bashrc`) or environment launcher.

Run a smoke test first:

```bash
cd RoboLab

CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 uv run python policies/gr00t/run.py \
    --headless \
    --remote-host 127.0.0.1 \
    --remote-port 5555 \
    --task BananaOnPlateTask \
    --num-envs 10 \
    --num-runs 1 \
    --open-loop-horizon 8 \
    --instruction-type default \
    --video-mode none
```

For a more stable estimate, use the largest `--num-envs` that fits GPU memory:

```bash
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 uv run python policies/gr00t/run.py \
    --headless \
    --remote-host 127.0.0.1 \
    --remote-port 5555 \
    --task BananaOnPlateTask \
    --num-envs 40 \
    --num-runs 1 \
    --open-loop-horizon 8 \
    --instruction-type default \
    --video-mode none
```

Useful setup-smoke tasks:

- `BananaOnPlateTask`
- `BananaInBowlTask`
- `BananasInBinThreeTotalTask`
- `UnstackRubiksCubeTask`
- `SauceBottlesCrateTask`

### Example 4-GPU Layout

For faster evaluation on a 4-GPU node, run two GR00T servers and two RoboLab workers:

| GPU | Process |
| --- | --- |
| 0 | GR00T server A |
| 1 | GR00T server B |
| 2 | RoboLab eval worker A |
| 3 | RoboLab eval worker B |

Each RoboLab worker should point to a different server port and receive a disjoint task shard. Keep the same model, embodiment tag, horizon, camera, image, and video settings across shards.

The GR00T server and Robolab client can also share a GPU, with smaller `--num-envs` parallel environments.

## RoboLab Observation Contract

The N1.7 DROID client sends this request shape to the policy server:

| Group | Key | Shape | Dtype |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Video | `video.exterior_image_1_left` | `[B, T, H, W, 3]` | `uint8` |
| Video | `video.wrist_image_left` | `[B, T, H, W, 3]` | `uint8` |
| State | `state.eef_9d` | `[B, T, 9]` | `float32` |
| State | `state.joint_position` | `[B, T, 7]` | `float32` |
| State | `state.gripper_position` | `[B, T, 1]` | `float32` |
| Language | `annotation.language.language_instruction` | `[B]` | string |

Use `T=1` for the current baseline. Map RoboLab `over_shoulder_left_camera` to GR00T `exterior_image_1_left`, and RoboLab `wrist_cam` to GR00T `wrist_image_left`.

The GR00T response contains chunked `action.joint_position` and `action.gripper_position`. Concatenate those actions and execute only the first 8 rows before querying the server again.

## Image Handling

Do not letterbox. Do not add black bars.

The validated RoboLab client sends 16:9 HWC `uint8` images at `180x320`. This is only the transport size; the N1.7 processor still applies its model-side image transform after receiving the image.

Avoid square client images unless deliberately running an ablation. Square stretching changes scene geometry, and square padding reintroduces letterbox bars.

## Ablation Notes

Useful checks from the validation sweep:

| Factor | Outcome |
| --- | --- |
| 8 denoising steps instead of 4 | No meaningful full-suite improvement; roughly doubles DiT inference work. |
| Additional camera inputs | No stable improvement over left exterior + left wrist in the tested configs. |
| History frames | No stable improvement in the tested configs. |

## Outputs And Dashboard

For throughput sweeps, use `--video-mode none`. RoboLab still writes run summaries, task logs, HDF5 trajectories, timing, and per-task result rows.

For inspectable diagnostic runs, use:

```bash
--video-mode all --enable-subtask
```

`--video-mode all` writes both policy/sensor and viewport mp4s beside the task outputs. `--enable-subtask` populates score and failure-reason fields when task subtask tracking is available.

The RoboLab dashboard reads an output directory containing run folders:

```bash
robolab-dashboard --output-dir RoboLab/output --port 8080
```

The dashboard uses `episode_results.jsonl` as the canonical per-episode summary and discovers mp4s, per-env logs, and HDF5 files from each task directory.

## Troubleshooting

If the server returns `SVD did not converge`, save the task name and server log. This is a numerical robustness issue in the action decode path, not a RoboLab installation problem.

If RoboLab crashes before launching IsaacSim, check for duplicate argparse flags between RoboLab and IsaacLab's `AppLauncher`.
