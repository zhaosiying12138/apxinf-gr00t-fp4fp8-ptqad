# Hardware Recommendations

GR00T N1.7 has two hardware profiles: **fine-tuning** (needs GPU VRAM and compute) and **inference/deployment** (needs low latency). This guide helps you choose the right hardware for each.

## Inference Hardware

**Minimum:** 1 GPU with 16 GB+ VRAM, CUDA 12.6+.

The table below summarizes end-to-end inference frequency across tested platforms (GR00T N1.7, 4 denoising steps, 1 camera):

| Platform | VRAM | PyTorch Eager | With TensorRT | Use Case |
|----------|------|---------------|---------------|----------|
| H100 80GB HBM3 | 80 GB | 11.7 Hz | 35.9 Hz | High-frequency control, multi-env batch inference |
| H20 96GB HBM3 | 96 GB | 12.0 Hz | 29.4 Hz | Cost-effective datacenter inference |
| RTX Pro 6000 Blackwell | 96 GB | 12.8 Hz | 35.9 Hz | Workstation inference, development |
| RTX Pro 5000 72GB | 72 GB | 7.9 Hz | 24.7 Hz | Workstation inference |
| L40 | 48 GB | 7.8 Hz | 26.0 Hz | Cloud inference |
| L20 | 48 GB | 7.1 Hz | 23.3 Hz | Cloud inference |
| DGX Spark | 128 GB shared | 7.9 Hz | 10.1 Hz | Desktop edge, prototyping |
| AGX Thor | 128 GB shared | 8.9 Hz | 12.4 Hz | Robot-mounted edge deployment |
| Orin | 64 GB shared | 2.9 Hz | 6.6 Hz | Legacy Jetson edge |

> **Which frequency is this?** The rates above are the **model inference (replanning) rate** — how often the policy produces a new action *chunk*. This is not the same as the robot's **action-execution rate** or **camera-capture rate** (both ~30 FPS in the [real-world deployment guide](real_world_deployment.md#robot-platform)). Because each inference returns a multi-step action chunk, a ~10 Hz inference rate can sustain ~30 FPS execution via action chunking + asynchronous inference — you do **not** need 30 Hz inference to execute at 30 FPS.

### Key Insights

- **30+ Hz — high-frequency** (H100, RTX Pro 6000 with TensorRT): headroom for reactive, low-latency closed-loop control where sub-30 ms per-step latency matters.
- **10+ Hz — recommended minimum** (Thor, Spark with TRT; most dGPUs with torch.compile): sufficient inference rate for typical manipulation tasks (paired with action chunking to reach ~30 FPS execution).
- **< 10 Hz** (Orin with TensorRT): only suitable for slow, non-reactive tasks.
- **TensorRT Full Pipeline** provides 1.5--3.3x speedup over PyTorch Eager depending on platform. Biggest gains are on datacenter GPUs where backbone acceleration is significant.
- **torch.compile** is a good zero-effort middle ground (no engine build step), achieving 1.1--1.9x speedup across all platforms.

## Fine-Tuning Hardware

**Minimum:** 1 GPU with 40 GB+ VRAM. GR00T N1.7 is a ~3B parameter model (bfloat16).

| Setup | GPUs | VRAM per GPU | Global Batch Size | Notes |
|-------|------|-------------|-------------------|-------|
| Quick start / prototyping | 1x H100, L40, or A100 | 40--80 GB | 32 | Single GPU; sufficient for demo datasets |
| Recommended | 4--8x H100 or L40 | 40--80 GB each | 64--640 | Multi-GPU via torchrun; faster convergence |
| Full scale | 8x RTX Pro 6000 or DGX | 96 GB each | 640 | Large datasets, production fine-tuning |

### Key Details

- **Default fine-tuning** tunes the projector + diffusion action head (not the full LLM backbone), keeping peak VRAM under ~35 GB per GPU.
- **Enabling `--tune-llm` or `--tune-visual`** significantly increases VRAM — 80 GB+ per GPU recommended.
- **`--gradient-accumulation-steps`** can compensate for fewer GPUs. For example, 4 GPUs with 8 accumulation steps and per-GPU batch of 8 gives an effective global batch size of 256.
- **Reduce `--num-shards-per-epoch`** if host memory (not VRAM) is limited — this controls how much dataset is preloaded into RAM.
